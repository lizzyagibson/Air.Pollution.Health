## EDA

### PM 2.5 Species
```{r}
data_2015 <- read_csv("data_2015.csv")
all_long <- read_csv("all_long.csv")

all_long %>% filter(!(parameter_name %in% c("Humidity", "Temp", "NO2", "PM2.5", "SO2", "Ozone", "CO"))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = parameter_name, y = arithmetic_mean, color = parameter_name)) + 
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) + theme_bw() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1), legend.position = "none") +
  labs(y = "Concentration", x = "Pollutants", 
       title = "PM 2.5 Species Concentrations") + coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 1.25))
```

### Criteria Gases & Particulates
```{r}
all_long %>% filter(parameter_name %in% c("NO2", "PM2.5", "SO2", "Ozone", "CO")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = parameter_name, y = arithmetic_mean, color = parameter_name)) + 
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) + theme_bw() + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1), legend.position = "none") +
  labs(y = "Concentration", x = "Pollutants", 
       title = "Criteria Gas & Particulate Concentrations") + coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 42))
```

## PCA

A low-dimensional representation of the data that captures as much of the information as possible. The idea is that each of the n observations lives in p-dimensional space, but not all of these dimensions are equally interesting. PCA seeks a small number of dimensions that are as interesting as possible, where the concept of interesting is measured by the amount that the observations vary along each dimension. Each of the dimensions found by PCA is a linear combination of the p features. The first two principal components of a data set span the plane that is closest to the n observations, in terms of average squared Euclidean distance.

```{r}
#remove outcome and confounders from PCA matrix
pca_dat <- data_2015 %>% select(-resp, -day_of_week, -Temp, -Humidity, -date) %>% as.data.frame()

pr.out <- prcomp(~ . , pca_dat, scale = TRUE, na.action = na.omit)
names(pr.out)

  pc_out_plot <- as.tibble(pr.out$x) %>% 
  mutate(date = data_2015[1:108,]$date) %>% 
  mutate(day_of_week = data_2015[1:108,]$day_of_week) %>% 
  mutate(month = months(date)) %>% 
  mutate(Week = ifelse(day_of_week %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), "Weekend", "Week day")) %>% 
  mutate(Season = ifelse(month %in% c("January", "February", "December"), "Winter",
                         ifelse(month %in% c("March", "April", "May"), "Spring",
                                ifelse(month %in% c("June", "July", "August"), "Summer", "Fall"))))

pc_out_load <- as.tibble(pr.out$rotation)

pr.var = pr.out$sdev^2
# variance explained by each PC

pve = pr.var/sum(pr.var)
# Percent Variance Explained

percentage <- round(pve * 100, 2)
percentage <- str_c(colnames(pr.out$x), " (", as.character(percentage), "%", ")")
```

### 1. Scree Plot
```{r}
#Scree plot
#Elbow is at 3rd PC, meaning that the first 3 components explain most of the data
fviz_eig(pr.out)
```

### 2. Variance Plot
```{r}
plot(cumsum(pve), xlab = "Principal Component", 
     ylab = "Cumulative Proportion of Variance Explained", ylim = c(0,1), type = 'b')
```

### 3. Heatmap
```{r}
#heatmap of pollutant loadings on PC
autoplot(scale(pr.out$rotation)) + 
  labs(y = "Pollutants", x = "Principal Components", 
                                        fill = "Value", 
                                        title = "Individual pollutant loadings on Principal components") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))
```

### 4. Variable Plots

#### Eigenvectors
```{r}
#Plot of eigenvectors
# autoplot(pr.out, loadings = TRUE, loadings.colour = 'blue',
#          loadings.label = TRUE, loadings.label.size = 3) + theme_bw() + 
#   labs(title = "Biplot of first two Principal components")
#biplot of first 2 Principal components
#Graph of variables. Positive correlated variables point to the same side of the plot. Negative correlated variables point to opposite sides of the graph. longer (oranger) variables contribute more to the PC
fviz_pca_var(pr.out,
             col.var = "contrib", # Color by contributions to the PC
             gradient.cols = c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800", "#FC4E07"),
             repel = TRUE     # Avoid text overlapping
             ) + labs(color = "Contribution")
```

#### Variable Loadings
```{r}
melted <- melt(pr.out$rotation[,1:23]) %>% 
  mutate(variable.group = ifelse(Var1 %in% c("CO", "SO2", "NO2", "Ozone"), "Criteria Gases",
                                 ifelse(Var1 == "PM2.5", "PM 2.5", "PM Species")))
 
melted %>% filter(Var2 %in% c("PC1", "PC2", "PC3", "PC4")) %>% ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = Var1, y = value, fill = variable.group), stat = "identity") + theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~Var2) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1), 
                            legend.position = "bottom") +
    labs(y = "Value", x = "Pollutants", title = "Variable Loadings on Principal Components",
         fill = "Group")
```

### 5. Individual Plots

#### Profile Similarity
```{r}
#Graph of individuals. Individuals with a similar profile are grouped together.
fviz_pca_ind(pr.out,
             col.ind = "cos2", # Color by the quality of representation
             gradient.cols = c("#00AFBB", "#E7B800", "#FC4E07"),
             repel = TRUE, label = "none",     # Avoid text overlapping
             ) + labs(color = "Quality")
```

#### Group by
```{r}
#Qualitative / categorical variables can be used to color individuals by groups. The grouping variable #should be of same length as the number of active individuals
fviz_pca_ind(pr.out,
             col.ind = pc_out_plot$Season, # color by groups
             addEllipses = TRUE, # Concentration ellipses
             ellipse.type = "confidence",
             legend.title = "Season", label = "none")

fviz_pca_ind(pr.out,
             col.ind = pc_out_plot$Week, # color by groups
             addEllipses = TRUE, # Concentration ellipses
             ellipse.type = "confidence",
             legend.title = "Weekend", label = "none")
```

The principal component score vectors have length n = 122 for 122 days, and the principal component loading vectors have length p = 23 for 23 criteria gases, particulates, and PM species measured. PCA was performed after standardizing each variable to have mean zero and standard deviation one.
