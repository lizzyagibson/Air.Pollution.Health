# Introduction

**Describe your data set. Provide proper motivation for your work.**


**What questions are you trying to answer?**


**How did you prepare and clean the data?**


# Unsupervised Analysis/Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

*Here you can use any techniques as long as they are adequately explained. If you don’t find anything interesting, then describe what you tried, and show that there isn’t much visible structure. Data science is NOT manipulating the data in some way until you get an answer.*

**Is there any interesting structure present in the data?**

In the EDA, the first boxplot of the PM 2.5 species shows that by a large difference, sulfur is the pollutant with the highest concentration (and standard deviation). The second boxplot of Criteria gas and particulate concentrations shows that NO2 has a larger concentration than all of the PM 2.5 species combined. 

For the unsupervised analysis, we also used a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This is a low-dimensional representation of the data that captures as much of the information as possible, to which each of the n observations exists in a p-dimensional space. PCA seeks a small number of dimensions that are all as "interesting" as possible (not all dimensions are equally interesting), which is measured by the amount that the observations vary along each dimension. Each of the dimensions found by PCA is a linear combination of the p features. The first two principal components of a data set span the plane that is closest to the n observations in terms of average squared Euclidean distance. PCA requires strong assumptions, including multiple continuous variables, a linear relationship between all variables, a large enough sample size, correlations between variables to form uncorrelate components, and no significant outliers (as PCA is very susceptible to outliers). 

We chose PCA because the dataset contains a large amount of variables, and PCA will help to understand which variables comprise a majority of the variability in the data. 

**What were your findings? What insights into the data can you make?**

A heat map of the data reveals that PC1, which comprises most of the variability in the dataset (~35%), contains four out of five of the criteria air pollutants (PM 2.5, NO2, CO, and SO2). The fifth criteria air pollutant, ozone, was not in PC1 but did appear in the other PC's to varying extents. In fact, the plot of the eigenvectors shows that ozone is in a different dimensional space compared to all of the other variables in the dataset. NO2, CO, and SO2 are in a similar dimensional space, and PM 2.5 is more similar to those three criteria air pollutants, but is also in a different dimensional space. 

In comparing week days and weekends, there is a bit of overlap in the PCA. 



# Supervised Analysis

*You can use any of the classification/regression techniques that we learned in the course, or any other techniques as long as they are adequately described.*

**What predictor variables did you include?**


**What technique did you use, and why did you choose it? What assumptions, if any, are being made by using this technique?**


For our supervised analyses we used lasso and boosted random forests. 

**If there were tuning parameters, how did you pick their values?**


**How did you make your predictions?**


**Discuss the training/test performance if you have a test data set (or you could split the data into two parts).**


**Can you explain anything about the nature of the relationship between the predictors in your model and the predictions themselves?**


**What were your findings? Are they what you expect? What insights into the data can you make?**
